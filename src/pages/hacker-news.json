  "detailsResults": "It has been a fantastic learning project for React at a fairly complex level.",
  "detailsComments": "This is still a work in progress, something I add to and tinker with for fun. But the core functionality is there: lists of the stories and their comments. Also, the styling is very nearly pixel perfect, though the actual Hacker News uses a table element, so mine, which does not, is just slightly different.",
