  "detailsComments": "This actually started off as a professional development project to learn React's hooks and context API. It quickly became a viable application, so I pushed it forward and coordinated with the hackathon administrator to add some new features such as an idea pool, giving more in app control to the hackathon administrator, as well as getting some help from Josh Adams to add an admin panel. The entire project's state management, including a complex team creation form, runs entirely on the context API. Learning it and hooks was an awesome experience. It was only intended to be a desktop app, so below are a couple screenshots (using dummy data) of a couple sections.",
