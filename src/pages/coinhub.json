  "detailsComments": "I simply found a nice looking shot on Dribbble and decided to build out some of it. So far this has quite limited functionality, but the price data is accurate (from https://www.coinapi.io/). There are no shots for any of the the other views, so I'm not sure I'll add those. Nor was there a mobile shot, so I just flexbox the whole site. Serverless rocks. I decided to put the CoinAPI I am using here behind my own little backend service just for practice.",
